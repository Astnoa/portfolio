During my time at _Neopica_ I worked on _Hunting Simulator_ mainly as a level decorator.  
I was responsible for decorating 2 levels from scratch. The Scottish Highlands map and the French Oak map. I also helped re-decorate 3 other maps.  
Additionally, I did some asset creation/authoring, such as materials, setting up LOD's, collisions, optimisations and a whole lot of other smaller tasks.  
I also created some blueprint scripts in _Unreal Engine 4_. Such as the ambient audio and particle spawning you see in some maps(birds, leaves).
