During the development of Hunting Simulator 2 I was responsible for creating and co-designing every level in the game.

This mostly consisted of procedural tool development and defining the art pipeline for terrain. As well as working with the game designers and producer to find a visual look for each location.
Furthermore, I supported the whole art team with decorating, asset creation and optimisation. And making sure all gameplay elements in the levels were authored and working as intended.

Credits to the whole art team!
