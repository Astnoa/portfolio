I did my internship at Larian Studios in 2016. During my internship I had the chance to work on _Divinity - Original Sin 2_.   
I created a variety of small props, tweaked existing ones, and making variations from existing assets.



One of the larger assignments I received was creating a modular bridge. This was a tileset which the level decorators could use to create a variety of different bridge designs and it was used all over the game.

Overall my internship was a very interesting experience and I learned a lot of new things from my collegues, and about the production pipeline.
