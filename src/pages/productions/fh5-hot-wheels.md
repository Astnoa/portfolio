# Forza Horizon 5 - Hot Wheels
During the development of Forza Horizon 5 - Hot Wheels I was responsible for bringing the environment from the 2d design of the Ice Cauldron to a 3d whitebox. Together with level designer Nigel Norman we designed and tweaked the environment so it would fit the hot wheels tracks perfectly.

Afterwards, I sculpted the terrain, made a procedural snow recipe for the material splats and was also responsible for authoring the lava lakes.
Credits to the whole environment art team, art direction and especially the geology team who absolutely nailed the ice glaciers and volcanic rock compositions which you see in every screenshot.
